# Fact Sphere

### (From Portal 2)

> This Discord bot is pretty much just me putting some quotes from the Portal 2 fact sphere into the discord api and making it say random shit.

> Credit to Valve for being the original creators of Portal 2, and the Portal 2 Wiki for having the full list of quotes said by the fact sphere during gameplay.

## SIDE NOTE

> This project lacks a .env file, which is the file responsible for storing the bot's token, and should NEVER EVER be shared (ye see why its not included). To make the bot work, make a file named ".env", and add the following into it:

```env
TOKEN=The_actual_bot_token
```

> Where "The_actual_bot_token" is replaced with your actual bot token, which you can get from your bot on [The Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
